# Pass 7.38.42 — Mission narrative copy alignment

- Updated MC00 Mission Briefing to the approved Silverstone-aligned guest call-to-action.
- Updated MC01–MC12 mission subtitles to the locked narrative wording.
- Updated Mission Complete outcome copy to the approved system-specific wording.
- Updated the full Comms feed title/message set from Mission Start through Northern Flight.
- Existing persisted completion messages now refresh from the current canonical Comms scripts on load, so the new copy appears without clearing local storage.
- No gameplay, geofence, route, radar, audio or layout behaviour changed.
- Cache version bumped to 7.38.42.

# Pass 7.38.41 — Checkpoint marker visual match

- Checkpoint marker core now matches the guest/user marker visual language.
- Standard radar checkpoint core uses the same 10px cyan-white centre and tight glow as the user marker.
- Circuit radar checkpoint core uses the same 12px white centre and glow as the circuit user marker.
- Existing checkpoint expanding beacon pulse is retained.
- Marker positioning, checkpoint geofences, radar route logic and z-order are unchanged; the guest marker remains above the checkpoint marker.
- Cache version bumped to 7.38.41.

# Pass 7.38.40 — Radar depth / checkpoint beacons

## Scope
- Radar presentation only.
- No checkpoint coordinates, geofence logic, route progression, or mission mechanics changed.

## Changes
- Reworked the inner radar rim into a substantially stronger dark inset falloff so the circuit visually disappears beneath the bezel instead of meeting a hard edge.
- Reworked both pre-circuit and circuit checkpoint targets into compact double-flash beacon markers using the existing target positions.
- Checkpoint beacons use a bright core and short expanding ring pulse; no marker geometry or GPS behaviour changed.
- Added reduced-motion static beacon treatment.
- Cache version bumped to 7.38.40.

# Pass 7.38.39 — Radar rim / telemetry / checkpoint language

## Scope
- Radar presentation and radar-page copy only.
- No geofence, route, mission, animation, or checkpoint mechanics changed.

## Changes
- Strengthened the existing inner radar-bezel shadow so the circuit edge blends beneath the rim rather than meeting it abruptly.
- Changed TELEMETRY to MISSION TELEMETRY.
- Standardised pre-arrival radar messaging to CHECKPOINT AHEAD for every checkpoint; MC01 search state now reads LOCATING CHECKPOINT.
- Cache version bumped to 7.38.39.

# Pass 7.38.38 — MC02 Aero / Power optical centring

## Scope
- MC02 only.
- Aero and Power icon horizontal alignment only.
- No animation, timing, copy, state, sizing, or other card changes.

## Changes
- Aero shifted 9px left so the visible garage/fan artwork aligns with the centred CAPTURED label.
- Power shifted 8px left so the complete speedometer/needle artwork aligns with the centred CAPTURED label.
- Cache version bumped to 7.38.38.
